Step 1: Build Core Structure (Managers)
1.1. Event Manager (Step 1a)
What it does: Handles event creation, editing, and deletion.

Steps:

Define the Event class, which includes properties like event name, date, time, location, and description.
Implement methods for creating (add event), editing, and deleting events.
Create a temporary in-memory list of events (e.g., ArrayList) for now to store events.
Testing:

Ensure events can be added to the list, edited, and removed.
Test by outputting the list of events to the console or displaying them in a simple UI.
Verify that events are correctly created and updated.
1.2. Contact Manager (Step 1b)
What it does: Manages contacts pulled from Android’s contact system or entered manually.

Steps:

Define the Contact class with properties like name, email, and phone number.
Implement methods to add contacts to the guest list (using a temporary list for now).
Allow manual entry of contacts (for simplicity, don’t integrate with Android contacts just yet).
Testing:

Ensure contacts can be added, removed, and displayed.
Test by outputting the contact list to the console or displaying it in a UI component.
1.3. RSVP Manager (Step 1c)
What it does: Tracks guest invitations and RSVP statuses.

Steps:

Add an RSVP status field to each guest in the Contact Manager (e.g., Not Responded, Attending, Not Attending).
Implement methods to update the RSVP status for each guest.
Connect the RSVP status to events created by the Event Manager.
Testing:

Create a few mock contacts and events, invite contacts to events, and update their RSVP status.
Verify that RSVP statuses are correctly tracked and associated with the right event.
Step 2: Connect Components
2.1. Link Contact and RSVP Managers to Event Manager (Step 2a)
What it does: Makes the Event Manager pull contacts from the Contact Manager and track RSVP statuses via the RSVP Manager.

Steps:

For each event, implement a guest list that pulls from the Contact Manager.
Ensure that each contact has an RSVP status linked to the event.
Testing:

Ensure that events are correctly populated with a guest list and that RSVP statuses are correctly updated for each event.
Create mock events and manually update guest statuses to check functionality.
Step 3: Simplified UI
3.1. Basic Event Creation and Viewing UI (Step 3a)
What it does: Allows the user to create, view, and delete events.

Steps:

Build a simple interface to add event details (event name, date, time, etc.).
Display the list of events in a simple list view or scrollable UI.
Add buttons for editing and deleting events.
Testing:

Test that you can create, edit, and delete events through the UI, and that the event list updates correctly.
3.2. Basic Guest List and RSVP UI (Step 3b)
What it does: Displays the guest list for an event and allows the user to update RSVP statuses.
Steps:
Add a guest list view to each event’s details.
Provide options to manually update RSVP statuses (e.g., drop-down menu or buttons).
Testing:
Ensure that guests are correctly linked to their RSVP statuses in the UI.
Verify that updating an RSVP status changes the correct guest’s status.
Step 4: Permissions and Integration (Optional for Simplicity)
4.1. Decide on Contact and Calendar Integration (Step 4a)
Contacts: You could either use manual input for now or integrate with Android’s Contacts Provider once the core system is working.
Calendar: Decide whether to sync events with the native Android calendar, which can be integrated after the core event management system is working.
For now, skip this step if the goal is simplicity.
Step 5: Testing the Core
5.1. Unit Testing for Each Manager (Step 5a)
Write basic unit tests for:
Event creation, editing, and deletion.
Adding and updating contacts.
RSVP tracking.
5.2. Integration Testing (Step 5b)
Once all managers are connected, test the full flow:
Create an event.
Add guests.
Update their RSVP statuses.
Edit the event and check if the data remains correct.
Next Steps: Adding Complexity Later
Once the core structure is working, you can decide whether to integrate native calendar syncing, contact system, or even an external database if needed. For now, this step-by-step plan will allow you to get a functional prototype with minimal complexity.

Decision Tree Overview:
Step 1: Build core structure (Event Manager, RSVP Manager, Contact Manager).
Step 2: Connect the components.
Step 3: Create simple UI for interaction.
Step 4 (Optional): Decide on external integrations (contacts/calendar).
Step 5: Test individual components and then the full system.
